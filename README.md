# The Mark

This repository maps out the (work-in-progress) curriculum for **The Mark**, the pre-employment 16-week training phase of [Academy](https://www.notion.so/Academy-92e6a8b244894a4d9b7d0b785c3d4bd2)'s two-year programme.

Weâ€™re making a high-impact career in technology more accessible than ever before, unleashing the potential of those who deserve to go further, faster.

In line with this, we're open-sourcing this curriculum ([read more about this decision here](https://www.notion.so/Curriculum-Optimising-for-industry-and-employer-needs-f3da2eeea06e48b7872cf25c00c3026a)), under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Getting started
This repository mostly contains markdown files which are intended to be opened by as an [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/) (which provides a nice graph interface over the plain markdown files).

(It is written in [Obsidian-flavoured markdown](https://obsidian.md/features) - `[[` syntax indicates internal links that are navigable when opened in Obsidian.)

**1. Clone repository / download files**

If you are familiar with Git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:WeAreAcademy/curriculum-mark.git
```

Otherwise, download a `.zip` file from the drop-down under the *Code* heading of GitHub.

**2. Download Obsidian desktop**

See the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/) for instructions.

**3. Open the repository via Obsidian**

There are two suggested modes of navigation:

1. Via graph view - `Option + <click>` to navigate to a node of interest
2. From this `README.md` - `Cmd + <click>` to navigate to a linked page of interest

## Contents
This repository contains:

| Map name | Description | Suggested filter when viewing graph* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[[Outcome Map]]** | a graph of time-unbounded modules to learning outcomes (via topics and sub-topics) | `$OutcomeMap OR $LearningOutcome` |
| **[[Activity Map]]** | a graph of time-bounded weekly themes to learning outcomes (via sub-themes and challenges) | `$ActivityMap OR $Challenge OR $LearningOutcome` |

*\*Substitute `#` for `$` in the filters. We avoid using `#` here to avoid attaching these tags to this note itself.*

These both will (or, should) ultimately encompass the same learning outcomes, although presented differently - e.g. a given outcome appears only once in the [[Outcome Map]], but may appear several times (and under different themes) in the [[Activity Map]].

## Roadmap
### Current status
This is currently being used for internal planning and development. It has not yet been optimised for consumption by an external audience. Neither the [[Outcome Map]] nor the [[Activity Map]] are, in any fashion, complete.

This map is constructed through Markdown files with unique titles and Obsidian internal links. These Markdown files don't (currently) have much content or purpose other than to link to other Markdown files (and thus create the graph structure).

In its current status, we think you are _most_ likely to get _some_ value from this curriculum if you are the equivalent of Academy Faculty - i.e. you are involved in the design or delivery of training for early-career software engineering talent.

### Future plans
- [ ] Guides on navigating the [[Activity Map]] and [[Outcome Map]] in Obsidian graph view
- [ ] Nodes of the [[Activity Map]] to lead to self-contained Challenges
- [ ] [[Activity Map]] to be linked to [[Outcome Map]]
- [ ] Markdown files to have greater context inside them, separate from the graph
- [ ] Learning Outcomes and Challenges to link to resources

*and more...*
