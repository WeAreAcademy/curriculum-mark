This repository contains the open-source software engineering curriculum for **The Mark**, the pre-employment 16-week training phase of Academy's [two-year graduate programme](https://www.notion.so/Graduate-Programme-Building-early-career-tech-leaders-fd95d2f498814a50af004ce7279f63c7).

## Academy
[Academy](https://www.notion.so/Academy-92e6a8b244894a4d9b7d0b785c3d4bd2) is making a high-impact career in technology more accessible than ever before, unleashing the potential of those who deserve to go further, faster.

Introducing the launchpad for a fast-growth career in tech: a new graduate scheme that combines world class technology and leadership training with a career fast-track inside leading tech companies.

## Our curriculum
In its current status, we think you are _most_ likely to get _some_ value from this curriculum if you are the approximate equivalent of Academy Faculty - i.e. you are involved in the design or delivery of training for early-career software engineering talent.

(At a future point, it should be ready for use by somebody hoping to skill themselves in the fundamentals of software engineering.)

### A two-year programme
Our Graduate Programme is split into two main sections:
1. **The Mark** - 16 weeks of pre-employment training
2. **The Track** - 21 months of training concurrent with full-time employment

We split our curriculum into three pillars: *Technology* (software engineering), *Leadership* and *Performance* (personal goals).

### 16 weeks of pre-employment training
This repository contains the Technology curriculum for *The Mark* - the 16 weeks of pre-employment training..

The goal is to provide a foundation of competencies for an associate/junior software engineering role.

### Graph structure
![](assets/outcome-map.png?raw=true)

We're using a graph structure for our curriculum, as demoed in [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/3106d6740b624831b49813343e82275c?sharedAppSource=personal_library) (although the content is outdated).

## Getting started
This repository contains mostly markdown files which are intended to be opened by as an [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/).

Obsidian provides a nice graph interface over the plain markdown files, with connections between graph nodes made via internal links written in [Obsidian-flavoured markdown](https://obsidian.md/features) using `[[` syntax.

(Internal `[[` links are navigable in Obsidian, but not GitHub.)

To run locally:

**1. Clone repository / download files**

If you are familiar with Git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:WeAreAcademy/curriculum-mark.git
```

Otherwise, download a `.zip` file from the drop-down under the *Code* heading of GitHub.

**2. Download Obsidian desktop**

See the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/) for instructions.

**3. Open the repository via Obsidian**

**4. Navigate to graph view or a relevant note**

There are two suggested modes of navigation:

1. Via graph view - `Option + <click>` to navigate to a node of interest
2. Via note view - `Cmd + <click>` to navigate to a linked page of interest
