# The Mark

This repository maps out the (work-in-progress) curriculum for **The Mark**, the pre-employment 16-week training phase of Academy's two-year programme.

Weâ€™re making a high-impact career in technology more accessible than ever before, unleashing the potential of those who deserve to go further, faster.

We are open-sourcing this curriculum under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). We welcome all of the following:
- Usage, with attribution, of our materials
- Contributions and feedback

## Getting started
This repository mostly contains markdown files which are intended to be opened by as an [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/) (which provides a nice graph interface over the plain markdown files).

(It is written in [Obsidian-flavoured markdown](https://obsidian.md/features) - `[[` syntax indicates internal links that are navigable when opened in Obsidian.)

**1. Clone repository / download files**

If you are familiar with Git:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:WeAreAcademy/curriculum-mark.git
```

Otherwise, download a `.zip` file from the drop-down under the *Code* heading of GitHub.

**2. Download Obsidian desktop**

See the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/) for instructions.

**3. Open the repository via Obsidian**

There are two suggested modes of navigation:

1. Via graph view - `Option + <click>` to navigate to a node of interest
2. From this `README.md` - `Cmd + <click>` to navigate to a linked page of interest

## Roadmap
### Current status
This is currently being used for internal planning and development. It has not yet been optimised for consumption by an external audience.

At the moment, it is mostly a map from time-unbounded modules to learning outcomes (the [[Outcome Map]]), although it is being supplemented by a map from time-bounded themes to activities (the [[Activity Map]]). *Neither of these maps are complete.*

This map is constructed through Markdown files with unique titles and Obsidian internal links. These Markdown files don't (currently) have much content or purpose other than to link to other Markdown files (and thus create the graph structure).

In its current status, we think you are _most_ likely to get _some_ value from this curriculum if you are the equivalent of Academy Faculty - i.e. you are involved in the design or delivery of training for early-career software engineering talent.

### Future plans
- [ ] Guides on navigating the [[Activity Map]] and [[Outcome Map]] in Obsidian graph view
- [ ] Nodes of the [[Activity Map]] to lead to self-contained Challenges
- [ ] [[Activity Map]] to be linked to [[Outcome Map]]
- [ ] Markdown files to have greater context inside them, separate from the graph
- [ ] Learning Outcomes and Challenges to link to resources

*and more...*
