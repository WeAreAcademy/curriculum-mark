# Usage
## Intended audience
In its current status, we think you are _most_ likely to get _some_ value from this curriculum if you are the approximate equivalent of Academy Faculty - i.e. you are involved in the design or delivery of training for early-career software engineering talent.

(At a future point, it should be ready for use by somebody hoping to skill themselves in the fundamentals of software engineering.)

## Contents
This repository contains:

| Resource | Description | Suggested filter when viewing graph* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learning Outcomes | individual learning outcomes that are intended to be atomic | `$LearningOutcome` |
| **[[Outcome Map]]** | a graph of time-unbounded modules to learning outcomes (via topics and sub-topics) | `$OutcomeMap OR $LearningOutcome` |
| **[[Activity Map]]** | a graph of time-bounded weekly themes to learning outcomes (via sub-themes and challenges) | `$ActivityMap OR $Challenge OR $LearningOutcome` |

*\*Substitute `#` for `$` in the filters. We avoid using `#` here to avoid attaching these tags to this note itself.*

You can either view them in graph view by applying the relevant filter, or open up the pages for each in Obsidian through the internal links in the table.

### Outcome Map
The goal of the Outcome Map is to enumerate, in a structured way, the knowledge, skills and behaviours that we think make for a rounded associate software engineer.

We do this by:
1. Starting with certain modules (e.g. [[Practical problem-solving]], [[Tools of the trade]])
2. Mapping these to topics and sub-topics (e.g. [[Assertions and testing]], [[Git and GitHub]])
3. Mapping these to *Learning Outcomes*

**Status:** work-in-progress. Learning Outcomes are not exhaustive, particularly for later modules ([[Workplace simulation]], [[Bite-sized bonuses]]).

### Activity Map
The goals of the Activity Map are:
1. To systematically list learner activities that cover all the learning outcomes of the [[Outcome Map]]
2. To sequence these activities in a sensible narrative over the 16-week period of The Mark

We do this by:
1. Starting with certainly weekly themes (e.g. [[How to think like a software engineer]], [[How to perform CRUD operations on a database]])
2. Mapping these to sub-questions (e.g. [[How can I model relationships between entities？]], [[How can I interact with a database in a scripting language？]])
3. Enumerating activities with learning outcomes for these themes (e.g. [[Match the pseudocode]], [[Iterative and recursive conversion]])
4. Filling out activity instructions and related resources

**Status:** work-in-progress, currently between steps 2 and 3 (theme dependent).
