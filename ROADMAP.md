# Roadmap
## Current status
This is currently being used for internal planning and development. It has not yet been optimised for consumption by an external audience. Neither the [[Outcome Map]] nor the [[Activity Map]] are, in any fashion, complete.

This map is constructed through Markdown files with unique titles and Obsidian internal links. These Markdown files don't (currently) have much content or purpose other than to link to other Markdown files (and thus create the graph structure).

In its current status, we think you are _most_ likely to get _some_ value from this curriculum if you are the equivalent of Academy Faculty - i.e. you are involved in the design or delivery of training for early-career software engineering talent.

## Future plans
- [ ] Guides on navigating the [[Activity Map]] and [[Outcome Map]] in Obsidian graph view
- [ ] Nodes of the [[Activity Map]] to lead to self-contained Challenges
- [ ] [[Activity Map]] to be linked to [[Outcome Map]]
- [ ] Markdown files to have greater context inside them, separate from the graph
- [ ] Learning Outcomes and Challenges to link to resources

*and more...*
