# Philosophy
## Our context
As detailed in our [goals](GOALS.md), we are aiming prepare people for roles as associate/junior software engineers.

In the particular [Academy](https://www.notion.so/Academy-92e6a8b244894a4d9b7d0b785c3d4bd2) context, we are doing this over:
- 16 weeks of pre-employment training;
- with [competitively selected graduates](https://www.notion.so/Scholars-Identifying-and-diverting-future-leaders-into-tech-8fa991cdab284add9926bb690667f6e3);
- at no cost to our Scholars; and
- with a follow-on 21 month placement and programme.

## Our approach
We have a few principles. Sometimes, they may conflict, but we take them as guiding thoughts and try to deal sensibly with conflcits where they arise.

| Principle name | Prioritise... | ... over ... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gift independence | Instruction-light learning | Instruction-heavy learning |
| Cover fundamentals | Explicit sequencing | Discovery learning |

### Gift independence
In our context, we support Scholars into and during their employment - and, when they start work, they need to have an independence from us. We will have failed them if they need constant supervision and direction from us.

As such, we *prioritise instruction-light learning over instruction-heavy learning*.

To us, this means things like:
- Prioritise building activities ('try this') over lesson scripts ('listen to us explaining this')
- Design activities to be supplemented by Google instead of being entirely standalone

### Cover fundamentals
In our context, we have 16 weeks with Scholars before they start employment - and, when they start work, we want them to have covered the fundamentals. We will have failed them if they have never used a version control system.

As such, we *prioritise explicit sequencing over discovery learning*.

To us, this means things like:
- Identify important foundational skills (e.g. 'naming variables well') and target them instead of relying on learners picking them up by osmosis
