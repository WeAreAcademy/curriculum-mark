# Problem interpretation

In this challenge, you will interpret problems by producing example test cases for them.

We'll give you some coding katas.

Your task is to read through the coding katas and demonstrate your understanding of them by producing some tests for them.

### Learning outcomes
- [[Identify useful test cases]]
- [[Descriptively name tests]]
- [[Write tests using `jest` with JavaScript]]
