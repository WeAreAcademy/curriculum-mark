# Iterative and recursive conversion

In this challenge, you will refactor iterative algorithms into recursive algorithms, and vice-versa.

We'll give you an existing solutions to coding katas, along with some associated tests.

Your task is to:
- identify whether a given existing solution is iterative or recursive;
- refactor the solution into the alternative type.

### Learning outcomes
- [[Identify recursive and non-recursive algorithms]]
- [[Design a recursive algorithm]]
- [[Write pseudocode to represent an algorithm]]
- [[Implement pseudocode in JavaScript]]
- [[Refactor code without breaking tests]]
- [[Write tests using `jest` with JavaScript]]
