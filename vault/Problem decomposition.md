# Problem decomposition

In this challenge, you will decompose a single large problem into smaller problems.

We'll give you some coding katas.

Your task is to read through the coding katas and solve it in a way that demonstrates sensible decomposition.

### Learning outcomes
- [[Identify useful test cases]]
- [[Descriptively name tests]]
- [[Write tests using `jest` with JavaScript]]
