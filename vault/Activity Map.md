# Activity Map
*(Open me in Obsidian)*

The Activity Map is a graph of time-bounded weekly themes to learning outcomes (via sub-themes and challenges).

## Navigation
*Substitute `#` for `$` in the below filters. We avoid using `#` here to avoid attaching these tags to this note itself.*

- To show the Activity Map in Obsidian graph view, filter by tag: `$ActivityMap`.
- To include Challenges as end nodes, set the filter to  `$ActivityMap OR $Challenge`.
- To see how Challenges connect to Learning Oucomes, set the filter to `$ActivityMap OR $Challenge OR $LearningOutcome`

## Phase One
**The Mark: Phase One** is part-time, over 4 weeks.
