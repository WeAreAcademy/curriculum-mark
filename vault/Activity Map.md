# Activity Map
The Activity Map maps from Weeks to Activities (and ultimately Learning Outcomes), through intermediate staging posts (that you might think of as 'themes').

## Navigation
- To show the Activity Map in Obsidian graph view, filter by tag: `#ActivityMap`.
- To include Challenges as end nodes, set the filter to  `#ActivityMap OR #Challenge`.
- To see how Challenges connect to Learning Oucomes, set the filter to `#ActivityMap OR #Challenge OR #LearningOutcome`

## Phase One
**The Mark: Phase One** is part-time, over 4 weeks.

## Phase Two
