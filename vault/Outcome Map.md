# Outcome Map
The Outcome is a graph of time-unbounded modules to learning outcomes (via topics and sub-topics).

## Navigation
*Substitute `#` for `$` in the below filters. We avoid using `#` here to avoid attaching these tags to this note itself.*

- To show the Outcome Map in Obsidian graph view, filter by tag: `$OutcomeMap`.
- To include Learning Outcomes as end nodes, set the filter to  `$OutcomeMap OR $LearningOutcome`.
