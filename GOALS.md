# Curriculum Goals

We aim with our curriculum for The Mark to provide a roadmap by which someone can go from 'zero coding experience' to the competencies of an associate/junior software engineer.

Of course, this doesn't _nearly_ exhaust the field of software engineering.

Our goal is to get someone to that initial position (in a relatively short period of time), where they are ready to learn more and get things done in a real business context:
- **Prepared for large codebases.** They'll have previously been thrown into a large unknown codebase.
- **Prepared for real projects.** They'll have completed tickets, pull requests and deployments.
- **Prepared for communication.** They'll have given and received feedback, pair programmed and worked in teams.
- **Prepared for modern stacks.** They'll have worked with React, TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
- **Prepared to learn more.** They'll have built up concepts, vocabulary and skills in full-stack, functional and OO development.
- **Prepared for reality.** They'll have done a *lot* of Googling, testing and debugging.

At that point, we think that they'll be ready to join a team - and _continue learning_. 
- If they're an Academy Scholar, they'll continue on in [The Track](https://www.notion.so/Graduate-Programme-Building-early-career-tech-leaders-fd95d2f498814a50af004ce7279f63c7), 21 months of employment, coaching and mentoring.
- If they're not an Academy Scholar, they'll be able to continue to learn if given the right supportive platform and environment.
