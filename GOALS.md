# Curriculum Goals
> ðŸ§© **An incomplete view**
> This repository presents a very partial view of Academy's curriculum: it is limited to the *Technology* pillar of *The Mark*, the 16 week pre-employment training. It therefore excludes: both (a) the 21 months of *The Track* that runs concurrently with employment; and (b) the *Leadership* and *Performance* pillars of the programme.

Within the Technology pillar for The Mark, we aim to provide the competencies, roadmap and processes which can take someone to 'ready to start their first role as an associate/junior software engineer'.

At this point, we want them to be ready to learn more and get things done in a real business context:
- **Prepared for large codebases.** They'll have previously been thrown into a large unknown codebase.
- **Prepared for real projects.** They'll have completed tickets, pull requests and deployments.
- **Prepared for communication.** They'll have given and received feedback, pair programmed and worked in teams.
- **Prepared for modern stacks.** They'll have worked with React, TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
- **Prepared to learn more.** They'll have built up concepts, vocabulary and skills in full-stack, functional and OO development.
- **Prepared for reality.** They'll have done a *lot* of Googling, testing and debugging.

At that point, we think that they'll be ready to join a team - with much more learning to do. 
- If they're an Academy Scholar, they'll continue on in [The Track](https://www.notion.so/Graduate-Programme-Building-early-career-tech-leaders-fd95d2f498814a50af004ce7279f63c7), 21 months of employment, coaching and mentoring.
- If they're not an Academy Scholar, they'll be able to continue to learn if given the right supportive platform and environment.
