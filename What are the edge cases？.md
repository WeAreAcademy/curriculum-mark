# What are the edge cases?

In this challenge, you will try to identify some missing edge cases for some tests.

We'll give you some coding katas and some tests designed to cover a solution - but, some of these tests will be missing important edge cases.

Your task is to improve the rigour of our tests by:
- identifying edge cases not covered;
- writing tests for these edge cases.

### Learning outcomes
[[Identify useful test cases]]
[[Descriptively name tests]]
